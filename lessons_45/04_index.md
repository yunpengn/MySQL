# 4. Index

- Data structures for index
    - Hash map: good for unique key equality search
    - Sorted list: good for unique key equality search & range search, but very expensive for writes
    - Search tree: balanced between reads and writes, such as **B+ tree** and **LSM tree** and **skip-list**
